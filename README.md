(ML Legends) Final Project of Data Science in Production

# Project Title

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Data Science in Production" project by Team ‚ÄúML Legends‚Äù:

Our project focuses on the Sentiment Analysis of Kindle Book Reviews, aiming to classify them as Positive or Negative. We are utilizing the [Kindle Book Review Dataset], a rich collection of over 2 million reviews and associated metadata for a diverse range of Kindle books.

The dataset, in JSON format, includes attributes such as reviewer ID, product ID, reviewer name, helpful votes of the review, product metadata, review text, product rating, review summary, review time (in both unix and raw formats), and images posted by users after receiving the product.

Our initial step involves creating a Machine Learning model based on the "Kindle Store" reviews. The model's performance and insights will then guide our subsequent steps, including Data Ingestion. The beauty of this approach is that it allows us to extend our model to other datasets with the same schema, providing a robust and scalable solution for sentiment analysis across multiple categories.

## Getting Started
# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the code in this repository, you'll need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Git

You'll also need to install several Python libraries. The required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**: First, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of this repository.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the following command to navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```
Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Install the required Python libraries**: You can install all necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, you're ready to run the code in this repository!

## Usage

To use this project, you'll need to run specific scripts for data processing, model training, and prediction. Detailed instructions for running these scripts will be provided in subsequent sections of this README.

## Results
Our sentiment analysis model has shown promising results. After training on the "Kindle Store" reviews dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of XX%, a precision of XX%, and a recall of XX%.

Some interesting findings from our analysis include:

1. Finding 1: Briefly describe the finding here.
2. Finding 2: Briefly describe the finding here.
3. Finding 3: Briefly describe the finding here.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide valuable insights into customer sentiment in Kindle Store reviews.

We plan to extend our model to other datasets with the same schema, which will allow us to perform sentiment analysis across multiple categories.


## Contributing
