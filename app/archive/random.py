    "Scholarly to the extreme, this book assumes knowledge of political theory and of the Solidarity Movement. I had little of the former, none of the latter, and as a result the book did not make the impression on me it may have otherwise. I got the feeling that had I had the neccesary background the book would have been very thought-provoking and interesting.",
    "I'm not one of the sort of people who falls often for heart warming. I'm too bitter, too jaded... too educated to be able to gush openly about kindly regard for many things. This book, though, deserves that kind of praise.As you could gather from the blurbs from magazines, this is a hundred year old book that seeks to illustrate the lives of typical, everyday (not to say uninteresting) Americans. The book is short; it's stories are realistic. Thus, it gives great insight into our collective 'ancestry': a voice to the long-dead.I'm inclined to think that every time I mentally want to destroy America, in this book, again, could be found renewed hope and exploration. In this book one can find the stories of Lithuanians who set out to cross the ocean, of free black women finding for the first time life in a segregated south, of Greek pushcart workers who end up with $50,000 in the bank. More or less, these are the voices that give our community continuity.... and, well, I'm starting to ramble and make little sense....Just read the book....",
    "I hope this is one of many books just like this one! Heart-warming stories, you'll wish you'd known the person first-hand. I'm actually buying copies of this book for various friends that think the only history they need to know is on the History Channel!Well-written.",
    "This book comes Highly recommended. It gives an historical overview that most books miss. Words from the common person, struggling to survive and thrive are inspiring .",
    "Each story is engaging and interesting. The stories are about urban and rural life. The most wonderful aspect of these acccounts are how much in common we have as human beings and immigrants. The same struggles and hardships are experienced regardless of ethnicity, an eye opening read.",
    "It shipped well, and the book was in good condition, it was obvious that it was used, but in the sense like a 2 year old school textbook. Good stuff all in all.I also like how it was annotated at certain points, it helped me find out a few things I could not get when I read through a couple of sections. I highly recommended this seller.",
    "This guy doesn't have the foggiest clue how to be a good manager. For those of us that have worked for this horrible individual (who was fired fom his last railroad job) I say 'SAVE YOUR MONEY'. This is one of the biggest goofballs of all time!!! Ask anyone that has ever worked for him. You'll get the same response. He might as well have written a book about space travel or extra-terrestrials. He knows as much about that as he does good management.",
    "What elements make up a terrific boss? M. David Dealy is VP of Transport for the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad and co-author Andrew R. Thomas serves on the international business faculty of the University of Akron, so they blend scholarly savvy with applied business experience to analyze the question of elements which make exceptional bosses. These elements, outlined deftly in Defining The Really Great Boss, include high ethical standards, an ability to learn from mistakes, and the ability to approach their own superiors with action plans rather than complaints. Every boss should read Defining The Really Great Boss for insights on their own advancement.",
    "A colleague of mine recommended this book and I was pleasantly pleased to have read it. Unlike many of the pretentious, ivory tower books on leadership that seem to dominate the shelves, this one was written from the front lines. A super book for any boss, regardless of where they work or what title they hold.",
    "Kinsey makes a clinical contribution to the study of private warriors and military corporations. His attempt to define the various Private Military Firms that exist bogs the effort down and confuses when attempting to introduce an accepted typology. He acknowledges the difficulty in the exercise but falls victim to it nonetheless. Outside of this, he does a great job summarizing this history of freelancers through mercenaries to current day 'contractors'. He raises the need for greater oversight and regulatory guidelines for the entire industry. A solid contribution but retreads much of the same ground P.W. Singer covered in 2003 in Corporate Warriors."
